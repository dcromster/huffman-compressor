# huffman-compressor
Automatically exported from code.google.com/p/huffman-compressor


This program can only compress/decompress a single file.

It works fine under Linux, but may crash under Windows. However, when I debug it with Visual C++ Express 2010, everything is OK... ╮(╯~╰)╭

Anyway, I changed the label to OpSys-Linux.

The compression ratio is about 70% - 80%. It may be a little higher with ASCII files.

Todo
Rewrite it in C.
Switch to Adaptive Huffman Coding.
Add multiple files / folder support.
